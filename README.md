# doubleLinkedListsAct

## Created by: Alan Paul Garc√≠a Rosales

In this activity, the problem given is an unsorted binnacle, every register of the binnacle conatins information of a suspected hack, by using double linked lists I ordered this binnacle with the quicksort method by date and using classes, and for searching especific registers the binary search method because by the time we try to search, the binnacle is already sorted and this method gives us less time complexity, which means is more efficient.
